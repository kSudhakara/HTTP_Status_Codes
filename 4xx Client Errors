These indicate problems with the client's request. Here are the most common ones:

400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.

How to fix:
Check the request syntax, URL, or query parameters.
Ensure the client is sending a properly formatted request.

401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication, and the client did not provide valid credentials.

How to fix:
Ensure that the user is logged in and has valid credentials.
Set up or update authentication mechanisms like API keys, OAuth tokens, or login sessions.

403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource.

How to fix:
Check the permissions of the requested resource on the server.
Update server configurations, file permissions, or access control settings.

404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.

How to fix:
Check if the URL is correct.
Ensure that the resource exists on the server and is correctly linked.

405 Method Not Allowed: The HTTP method used is not supported for the requested resource.

How to fix:
Verify that the server supports the method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) for the requested resource.
Adjust the client request or server configuration.

408 Request Timeout: The client took too long to send the request, and the server closed the connection.

How to fix:
Optimize the client request to send data faster.
Increase the serverâ€™s timeout limit if necessary.

429 Too Many Requests: The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).

How to fix:
Reduce the frequency of client requests.
Implement proper rate limiting on the server side and handle it on the client side with retries after a delay.

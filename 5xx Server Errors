These indicate problems on the server side, often unrelated to the client request.

500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

How to fix:
Check server logs for detailed error messages.
Debug and fix issues in server-side code or configuration files.

502 Bad Gateway: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server.

How to fix:
Ensure that the upstream server is functioning properly.
Check network configurations between the servers.

503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request, often due to overload or maintenance.

How to fix:
Reduce server load or scale up resources (CPU, memory, etc.).
Implement a retry mechanism or serve a "maintenance" page during downtimes.

504 Gateway Timeout: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

How to fix:
Investigate why the upstream server is slow or unresponsive.
Adjust timeout settings on the gateway/proxy server.
